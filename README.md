# Project : SQL Zoo

> SQL Zoo is one of the few resources online that actually lets you build and run queries against existing tables.
Each tutorial will show you a table and then have you run queries against it to answer specific questions. Some of the
queries, particularly at first, are quite simple. They definitely get more challenging towards the end and can be real
head scratchers.
